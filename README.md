## My process


### Built with

- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Working on this project I was not too concerned about getting the design as perfect as possible, but instead I focused more on the responsiveness part. Thinking of the card as a component, I've tried to use flex to position the elements on the screen instead of using position relative and absolute as I used to. Also, this is the first project I've built with mobile-first workflow in mind.
From this project on I'll try to use rem and em instead of px for fonts, margins, paddings, etc.
